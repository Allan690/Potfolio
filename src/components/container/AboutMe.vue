            > I am a fullstack developer at Andela where I work with a distributed team on a trips and travel product.
            </p>
            <p>
            Currently, I am available to freelance or work fulltime in the roles of fullstack engineer, backend engineer or frontend engineer. I however have a particular bias for the backend.
            </p>
            <p>I primarily use node.js to build my REST and GraphQL APIs, with either MongoDB or Postgres for the backend, and redis for caching. On the frontend, I am comfortable using React/Redux, Angular or Vue, depending on my needs. </p>

            <span class="introTitle">CURRENTLY</span>
            <p>At Andela, I have learned to work as a productive member of a distributed team, to give and receive actionable, specific and kind feedback, to manage people(as a product coordinator), build relationships with stakeholders, to build and maintain large web applications, to write clean, and maintainable code, and to tinker with APIs. ðŸ˜Ž</p>

                    <p>The first programming language I learned was Python.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>I did CS. The first 2 years of campus were hell.ðŸ˜°</p>

                <li>
                    <p>My real break in programming came in my final year, when I built a native windows app using C# and Winforms to capture and monitor class attendance. My supervising lecturer loved it, and offered me a job among other things. It never materialized.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>I built my first API during Andela's bootcamp. Since then, I've built more than 20 APIs with increasing complexity.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>I was never, ever remotely interested in JavaScript until Andela happened.</p>
